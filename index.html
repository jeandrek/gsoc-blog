	  Got athrate-amrr & athrate-onoe working (before I only had

	  Martin (my mentor) recently let me know of an existing patch for
	  athn(4) written by James Brown and suggested I could use parts or
	  merge with my effort.  Since it's written by someone more
	  knowledgeable I'll take the latter path.  Some of the changes are
	  very similar; others are just more sensible, or reflect stuff of
	  which I was ignorant.  So I changed it enough to compile and work as
	  before, merging it with a bit of my previous work.  From here I can
	  look into rate adaption, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Also made a few changes to ath(4) &ndash; ideally hostapd(8)
	  would work (if that's possible at this point), but not yet.

	  I've made a few gradual changes to athn(4).
	  <code>ieee80211_tx_complete</code> is now called, and presumably
	  <code>athn_get_radiocaps</code> behaves now as did
	  <code>athn_get_chanlist</code> before.  It works on 2.4GHz and 5GHz.

	  Turns out I hadn't actually fixed that.  It happened whenever
	  <code>ath_start</code> was invoked by the <code>ath_tx_proc</code>
	  family (without <code>IEEE80211_TX_LOCK</code>) and then called
	  <code>ieee80211_encap</code>.  Removing the call to
	  <code>ieee80211_encap</code> would fix this as the call was

	  All of that is fixed now, except that if the code sets

	  I couldn't reproduce the crash I thought was caused by wpa_supplicant

	  After making the code regarding getting channels behave (mostly)
	  correctly, adding <code>IEEE80211_C_WPA</code> to
	  <code>ic_caps</code>, and restoring/adjusting
	  <code>athrate-sample.c</code>, wpa_supplicant connects to my network

	  things need to be cleaned up, fixed, and made less hacky).  mdnsd
	  (Bonjour) causes an assertion to fail during some ioctl.
	  wpa_supplicant also sometimes seems to crash the system based on the
	  exact sequence of commands used to set Wi-Fi up, so I'll also need to

          Trying to build athn(4) on the wifi topic results in a lot of errors
          in multiple arnXXXX.c files.  Trying to build ath(4) on the other hand
          seemed to result in fewer errors.  So it might be better to convert
          ath first.
        </p>
        <p>
          I substituted <code>ic_macaddr</code> for <code>ic_myaddr</code>;
          made <code>newstate</code> take a VAP; replaced
          <code>ic->ic_ifp->if_softc</code> with <code>ic->ic_softc</code>;
          changed some other references; haphazardly disabled swathes of
          (important) code (a lot of important functions); and added a
          few random stopgaps.  Eventually it compiled without error;
          <code>ieee80211_ifattach</code> panicked but taking the contents of
          <code>rtwn_get_radiocaps</code> served as a stopgap.  Thus it was
          able to boot, and <code>ath0</code> was shown by sysctl.

          Creating a VAP with ifconfig is (unsurprisingly) still far away (it

	  As noted by
	  <a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/Converting_drivers_to_the_new_wifi_stack/">
	    Martin's guide</a>,
	  the main difference in new style drivers is the VAP concept.  To that

	  <code>struct ieee80211vap</code>.  So whereas before it would look
	  something like this:

	<img src="old.png" alt="Old representation" height="174">
	<p>
	  Now for any driver, the representation will look more or less like
	  this: 
	</p>
	<img src="new.png" alt="New representation" height="294">
	<p>
	  By comparing with FreeBSD ath(4) & the new rtwn driver:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Some new functions exist e.g. <code>ath_vap_create</code>,
	    <code>ath_vap_delete</code>, <code>ath_parent</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Methods previously existing on the <code>struct ifnet</code> are
	    gone, e.g. <code>if_start</code> (replaced by
	    <code>ic_transmit</code>) <code>if_watchdog</code>,
	    <code>if_ioctl</code> and <code>if_init</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Some methods previously existing on <code>struct ieee80211com</code>
	    are shifted to the VAP e.g. <code>iv_recv_mgmt</code>,
	    <code>iv_newstate</code>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <code>sc_ec</code> is gone (or rather never existed in FreeBSD).

        <p>
          ath(4) and athn(4) support somewhat different sets of hardware.  The
          most obvious difference in implementation is that ath(4) uses the
          Atheros HAL.  This was initially a blob but
          <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Njc1MA">
            open-sourced in 2009</a>.
          According to the
          <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/dev/ath_hal%284%29">
            FreeBSD wiki</a>,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The Atheros HAL is an abstraction layer which attempts to hide much of the card specific configuration from the rest of the atheros wireless driver.</p>
          <p>The HAL takes care of the MAC, baseband and radio. It exports a set of routines which allow the atheros wireless driver to do certain tasks (set channel, configure TX queue, queue TX packet, queue RX buffer, setup interrupts, do calibration, set/get TX power, configure beacon parameters, enter power saving/sleep mode, etc.)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It doesn't seem that it'll require any changes (except ah_osdep.c).
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for example, athn.c has routines that directly change particular
          registers (using <code>AR_WRITE</code> i.e. <code>sc_ops.write</code>
          which might resolve to <code>athn_pci_write</code>), the lowest-level
          routines being implemented in if_athn_pci.c & if_athn_cardbus.c,
          whereas ath.c uses the higher-level routines already provided by the HAL.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>ath_softc</code> and <code>athn_softc</code> are the most
          important structs in both, which, presumably, will have a few mutexes
          on them when finished (as FreeBSD).  ath(4) seems to be the more
          complicated of the two drivers.

        <p>
          This far I have ensured that the wifi branch builds and runs on the
