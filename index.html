      <h2>Background and goals</h2>
      <p>
	<a href="https://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> is an open-source operating
	system in the BSD family.  The NetBSD Project has been
	<a href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/Wifi_renewal_on_hg/">
	  working to adapt the latest FreeBSD Wi-Fi stack</a>.  This will
	result in various improvements in functionality.  For example, NetBSD
	will support IEEE 802.11n, and one can use multiple virtual access
	points (VAPs) with the same physical Wi-Fi adapter (use cases include
	multiple access points, etc.).  Consequently NetBSD's wireless drivers
	are being converted to work with the new stack, and this Google Summer
	of Code, I set out to do that for those for Atheros hardware.
	Originally I intended to convert
	<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/athn.4">athn(4)</a>
	followed by
	<a href="https://man.netbsd.org/ath.4">ath(4)</a>, if time allowed.
      </p>
      <h2>What was done</h2>
      <p>
	I ended up first converting ath(4).  I got Wi-Fi to begin to work on
	<a href="blog.html#wifi-working-ath-4">6 June</a>, and it was
	basically functional by <a href="blog.html#encap-caps-ath-4">22 June</a>
	(about three weeks before the midterm evaluation).
      </p>
      <p>
	I began converting athn(4) on 27 June and by 8 July I had it in a
	working state.  Later my mentor let me know of an existing patch that
	had been written for athn(4) by James Browning in 2022.  In some ways
	it was similar; in other ways better, so I started over based on that
	patch (getting it to a point were it compiled and worked didn't take
	very long, using my existing conversion for reference).
      </p>
      <p>
	From then I made some other fixes and changes to both ath(4) and
	athn(4) (e.g. <a href="blog.html#rate-adaption">rate adaption</a>).
	The <a href="blog.html">blog</a> has more details on what I did, and
	there are emails between myself and Martin and others on NetBSD's
	tech-net mailing list.
      </p>
      <p>
	On 11 August my latter patch for athn(4) based on James Browning's was
	merged into the wifi topic of NetBSD's Mercurial repository (but not
	ath yet &ndash; athn is the preferred driver for the chipsets it
	supports).
      </p>
      <p>
	Initially, I didn't have any plan of converting athn(4) for USB (in
	addition to PCI and CardBus) since I had no hardware.  But since there
	was still plenty of time, I did end up trying to do this, in spite of
	not yet being able to test it, and I have ordered an Atheros USB dongle
	which will arrive in about a month.
      </p>
      <h2>What to do from here</h2>
      <p>
	In a few weeks I should know if what I've done for USB works, and then
	I plan on getting it to work if it doesn't (which should not take
	long).  Then the best approach for converting athn(4) at USB (with or
	without usbwifi) can be evaluated (which is the intention).
      </p>
      <p>
	Since ath(4) is working, I hope to likely have the code merged into the
	wifi topic of NetBSD's Mercurial repository soon (after making any
	changes in response to feedback I receive from Martin).  In the case of
	ath(4) there is one kludge (a constant was defined both in the Atheros
	HAL and the new Wi-Fi stack, so I added an #ifndef to the former) that
	should probably still be dealt with.
      </p>
